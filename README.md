[The causal effect of economic growth on gender inequality](https://github.com/fanpowei/Econometric-research/blob/main/The%20causal%20effect%20of%20Economic%20growth%20on%20Gender%20Inequality%202.pdf)

## Goal
This is a causal analysis aims to answer if an increase in economic development would improve gender equality. Although people have made a lot of efforts in this area, in order to reveal the seriousness of the problem and present stronger evidence for women to defend their rights in court, still, all the information tells us that what we have done is not enough. Therefore, connecting gender inequality with economic growth might give people a way to analyze equal rights from a different perspective.
